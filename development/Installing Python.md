# Installing Python #

Some version of Python may already be installed on your computer. For the purposes of this course, however, it is convenient to install a complete Python package that includes a full range of features important to scientific and engineering use:

* Python and IPython interpreters
* IPython notebook server
* Base collection of computational packages useful for scientific and engineering calculations.
* A package manager to facilitate installation and maintenance of additional packages.

Examples of complete Python packages from commercial vendors include:

* Canopy from Enthought
* [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) from Continuum Analytics
