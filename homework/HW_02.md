# CBE 20255: Homework 02 #
Due: Wed., January 29, 2014

**Problem 1.** Automobile airbags are designed to protect occupants in the event of front and side impact crashes. 
The bags are inflated with nitrogen generated by the explosive decomposition of sodium azide. 

2 NaN<sub>3</sub> &rarr; 2 Na + 3 N<sub>2</sub>

Highly reactive sodium would be a hazard at a crash site. 
A clever piece of chemical engineering is to add potassium nitrate (\\(KNO_{3}\\)) and silica (\\(SiO_{2}\\)) to the airbag which react with \\(Na\\) though the following balanced reactions.

10\, Na+2\, KNO_{3} &rarr; K_{2}O+5\, Na_{2}O +N_{2}

K_{2}O+5\, Na_{2}O+SiO_{2} &rarr; Glass

With proper design of the initial charge, one can avoid the net production of sodium with the added benefit of generating further nitrogen. 

(a) Perform a generation consumption analysis to determine a process stoichiometry that avoids the net production of \\(Na\\), \\({2}O\\), or \\(K_{2}O\\). Show your work, including the stoichiometric matrix and the final net stoichiometry.

(b) 98 grams of \\(N_{2}\\) are needed to fill a typical airbag. Specify (in grams) the required amount of sodium azide, potassium nitrate, and silica to be loaded into the airbag.

**Problem 2.** Murphy, Problem P1.28.

**Problem 3.** Murphy, Problem P1.30. 

**Problem 4.** Murphy, Problem P1.42. This is an involved problem that will take time to complete, so get an early start. For this problem (and this problem only) feel free to work with a partner. If you do, you should both submit solutions (even if identical), and indicate who you worked with.
