      "The [Mk 50 torpedo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_50_torpedo) was designed a lightweight device that could be used against fast and deep-diving submarines. A critical part of its design is the Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System (SCEPS) in which sulfur hexaflouride gas is sprayed onto a solid block of lithium to produce the heat necessary to run a steam-powered, closed-cycle rankine engine. [Sulfur hexaflouride is relatively inert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-XbjFn3aqE), but does react with lithium at an operating temperature of about 790 &deg;C via the stoichiometric reaction\n",
